# Data X Power Fellowship

**Fellows:** Vivienne Maxwell & Wayne Shaw

## **Project Goal**

The goal of this project is to put the power back in the hands of the people most affected by environmental racism. We aim to develop a web and mobile-based application that will help individuals call out specific chemical plants who emit one or more of the following most toxic environmental air pollutants (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, methane, ozone). The app will consist of a map with the exact names and locations of these harmful plants. The user will be able to enter an address and measure the proximity of these harmful chemical plants. There will be explanations for why these plants were highlighted, why these gases are harmful to humans and the planet, and different calls to action (to be determined). 

## **Background on Environmental Racism**
Environmental racism is a prevalent social and health issue in the United States. People of color are disproportionately exposed to harmful health and environmental risks in their neighborhoods and at their job (Bullard, B.M., 1993). A 2018 study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that BIPOC communities face a 28 percent higher health burden compared to the general population and African Americans are even more impacted, facing a 54 percent higher health burden. A recent study published in Nature highlights resident scientists’ research in which they set up monitors to test the air quality in California during the height of the pandemic and found that the whole ecosystem air quality was much worse for people of color and that black communities in particular were exposed to more pollutants. This is clearly an issue disproportionately affecting a subgroup of the American population and our aim is to develop a tool that will help these individuals fight back. 

## **Description of Deliverable**

### **Preview of the final product**
[Wayne, could you insert a screenshot of the map you created in arc GIS just to give an idea of what we’re thinking of creating] [You can also add a few sentences about how we’ll sort the plants by industry and by gas to allow the user to target specific industries or to go after emitters of specific noxious gases] 

### **Data**
The chemical plant data is from Climate TRACE. This gives us the locations and emitted gases of each plant. We are thinking of overlaying demographic data (possibly from the census, but exact data TBD) to highlight how these plants are located in neighborhoods with predominantly BIPOC and lower-income residents. 


### **Software**
We have not decided on a specific mapping software, but are leaning towards ArcGIS. The idea would be to create a responsive mobile-first website (that can adapt to various screen sizes) and embed the map into the landing page of the website. However, we have limited web design experience, so further research is needed to determine how exactly users will interact with this map.
